- Benchmark Mantid and SXD2001 performance and accuracy - Should be done by Pascal?
- Translation of ALFnew interface to Mantid - needs investigation

### Powder Diffraction

- Bring ISIS diffraction up to current version of Mantid
- Harmonise diffraction scripts for ISIS across instruments
- Build Diffraction system tests
- Harmonise diffraction workflow between ISIS and SNS
