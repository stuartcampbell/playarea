## Diffraction

Instruments:

- **ISIS** - Gem, Engin-X, Hrpd, Osiris, Pearl, Polaris, SXD, Wish, Ines
- **SNS** - SNAP, NOMAD, VULCAN, POWGEN

Requirements:

### Single Crystal

START>>>
{
	"labels" : "SSC,Single Crystal"
}
<<<END

- Benchmark Mantid and SXD2001 performance and accuracy - Should be done by Pascal?
- Translation of ALFnew interface to Mantid - needs investigation

### Powder Diffraction

- Bring ISIS diffraction up to current version of Mantid
- Harmonise diffraction scripts for ISIS across instruments
- Build Diffraction system tests
- Harmonise diffraction workflow between ISIS and SNS

### Mantid Calibration

START>>>
{
	"labels" : "SSC,Calibration"
}
<<<END

### Planning Tools
